    <h1><code>hash()</code> and <code>seq()</code></h1>
    <card>
        <p>Public Data Cryptography avoids jargon, abstractions, design and standards committees by describing
            easily understandable processes using <strong><i>only two function interfaces</i></strong>.
            <br>&nbsp<br>
            These two functions are <code>hash()</code> and <code>seq()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>All "Public Data Cryptography" is
            deterministic process and result of these two functions applied to
            different sequences using different implementations
            of these two functions.
        </p>
        <spacer></spacer>
    </card>
    <card>
        <h2><code>hash(<i>input</i>)</code></h2>
        <p>The function <code>hash()</code> is already considered to be defined
            by existant public cryptography. It already has a known interface
            in which a single <code>input</code> returns a verifiable result.
        </p>
        <p>Existant common language also refers to <code>hash()</code> <i>results</i> 
            as "hashes" but this gets easily confused with the term for the 
            function itself. As such, we rely upon another common term for hash 
            results which is <code>proof</code>, as in "proof specific bytes in
            specific order were passed to a hash function".
         </p>
         <spacer></spacer>
    </card>
    <card>
        <h2><code>seq(<i>input1</i>, <i>input2</i>, ...)</code></h2>
        <p>The only new term we will introduce is <code>seq()</code> which is
            identical to <code>hash()</code> except it takes <i>multiple arguments</i>
            and returns a unique <code>proof</code> for those arguments in that order.
         </p>
         <p>As such, <code>seq()</code> is a <i>sequential</i> proof function.

    <h1>Authoring sequential proof functions</h1>
    <card>
        <p>We will write two rudimentary but illustrative sequence functions.</p>
        <code-highlighter script-id="simple-proof1"></code-highlighter>
        <p>The second is similar to the first but proof addresses are formed
            that are unique to the sequence of inputs thus far, which results
            in proofs that are good for "namespace" detection without revealing
            other information.
        </p>
        <code-highlighter script-id="simple-proof2"></code-highlighter>
    </card>
    <card>
        <p>Both functions <code>hash()</code> all the inputs but each makes
        different considerations as to what state it provides to the hash
        function.</p>
        <p>Let's modify the first function to return us not only the final
            proof but also all the inclusions it derived from the assembly.
        </p>
        <code-highlighter script-id="simple-proof1-inc"></code-highlighter>
        <p>In traditional data-structures these inclusions would be considered
            "merkle links." However, in Public Data Cryptography, <strong>we are not encoding
            data into a structure</strong>. At this layer, we do not have "types" and
            therefor cannot distinguish "links" from any other input.
        </p>
        <p>There is an observable point in the impelmentation of these algorithms that
            data is seen to be "linked" but this is not a property of the data itself.
            Proof results are only proof of a specific unique assembly, meaning they
            only prove that certain bytes were passed to a hash function in an algorithm
            specified order.
        </p>
        <p>What makes <i>input</i> a universal many-to-many link reference is the fact
        that the security of the hash function guarantees there will not be conflicts,
        so assemblies can be differentiated from references to assemblies with sufficient
        knowledge of the assembly that arrived at the proof. If one sees a hash they
        know to be derived from a particular algorithm and assembly they have knowledge
        of it as a link, but this knowledge is derived from determinism inherent to the 
        cryptographic process and not from any encoding of the data itself.
        </p>
    </card>
    <card>
        <p>There is a hazard to this kind of programming when sufficient context is
            not included in the assembly. For instance, it's common to use a small set of
            integers as tokens when encoding common type definitions, which would
            be equivalent to something like <code>seq(3, 'my string')</code>.
        </p>
        <p>To Public Data Cryptography this only means a number followed by bytes derived from
             "my string", it does not carry the semantic meaning of a string.
        </p>
        <p>If we return to the second proof function, notice how the second round
            of hashing is implemented.
        </p>
        <code-highlighter script-id="simple-proof2"></code-highlighter>
        <p>We could arrive at a proof differentiated from the first function by
           only passing the tail from earlier. Instead, we are going through the 
           work of maintaining the tail passing in each round to form the same
           dependent sequence going into the hash function. This differentiates
           this algorithm from future algorithms because there is no mistaking the
           nature of algorithm when observing the bytes as passed to the hash function.

    <h1>Merkle Tracing</h1>
    <card>
        <p>This form of cryptography is dubbed "merkle tracing" as it carries the properties
            of merklization but is not a data structure, only the cryptographic "trace"
            of such process as proof and inclusions.
        </p>
    </card>
    <card>
        <p>To demonstrate how this might be useful we should write a function that
            works with recusive assemblies and inclusions.
